<h3>2/33/15</h3>
<p>Breaking of the glass woke me up.She was there whining about how much she hated it.The highs the lows and everything in between.The music played along and I hoped it would swallow the noises that inflated my mind.How did we end up like this.I hated the smell, her omnipresent perfume.I did not want her to feel the pain alone but I could not help but just shut myself out.I knew I was being selfish but wa better than being dragged into the mud for something I did not wholy carry the blame.</p>
<p>Moments later the window opened and I had this music playing out loud.A tune so melodious like it was crafted for the moment.This was dream after all.How did I expect her to want to fight me.We knew what our agreement meant to us.A blood pact of some sort, two bound for an eternity of misery
